# sCrypto - Cryptocurrency trading bot

## Overview
Development of a trading bot in Java for autonomous cryptocurrency exchange. The plan is to make two bots, simpler and more complex. A simple bot monitors the movement of prices for a certain time and on that basis concludes when buying a cryptocurrency, ie selling. Once a simple bot is developed, a more complex one will be developed, which will recognize trends on various websites and social networks. A dashboard will also be made for it.
